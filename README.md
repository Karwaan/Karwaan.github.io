I will bring forward to you an ongoing investigation, infinitely, because there are two figures who cannot be seen: the terrorist and the ghost. The hunt is similar to a sentence that may run on, but is it because there is no resolution to the sentence or otherwise known as an ending or as an answer? The ghost hunt has a resolution, yet it is low. The investigation continues, even though it may never resolve itself, the storyteller may die before the story could end.

In this rendition of the hunt, the name is redacted, but is he that is known to haunt, also known as the ghostterrorist.

For a Ghost Hunter, to better understand a ghost, they look to its past, to understand why this ghost may haunt. In this one's past, we can see that the ghostterrorist can take multiple forms, and at the same time, have no form at all.

To preface, I had come to find the ghostterrorist in the attempts to separate the two. My primary conflict had come from the difference between the definitions of the words terror and horror. Horror is the feeling of revulsion that usually follows a frightening sight, sound, or otherwise experience. By contrast, terror is usually described as the feeling of dread and anticipation that precedes the horrifying experience. But perhaps the lens of time is not applicable in delineating these identities, especially because of both of their capabilities to haunt.
